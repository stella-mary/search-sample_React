        <p>Child is the father of man, statement by the great romantic poet William Wordsworth, has great dimensions of meaning. Childhood is that blissful stage of life where man’s heart is crystal clean of any superficiality and evil intentions. The innocence and simplicity of a child is without any impressions of the social influence. They are blissfully ignorant of the difference between good and bad, truth and lie; the differences which are fed to them by the society. In this manner, they are more mature and ‘adult’ than a full-grown man. The adults can learn from children the natural innocence, simplicity and love for each and every thing, they come in contact with. In the present society suffocated with violence, wars, artificiality and malignant lies, children can be a live source of inspiration and human values. They can teach us to be better human beings to create a better world to live in.</p>
